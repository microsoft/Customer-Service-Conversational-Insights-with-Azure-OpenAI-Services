### Use case / scenario

An analyst managing large volumes of conversational data needs a solution to visualize key insights and uncover patterns using natural language. An interactive dashboard enables them to explore rich, actionable insights for faster, and more informed decision-making.
 
This solution empowers analysts with tools to ask questions and receive real-time, contextualized responses. It streamlines problem-solving, enhances collaboration, and fosters innovation by making data-driven insights accessible and shareable.

The sample data used in this repository is synthetic and generated using Azure Open AI service. The data is intended for use as sample data only.
