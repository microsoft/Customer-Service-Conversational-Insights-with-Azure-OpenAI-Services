### Overview

This solution accelerator enables customers with large amounts of conversational data to use generative AI to surface key phrases alongside operational metrics. This enables users to discover valuable insights for targeted business impact.

**Version history:** An updated version of the Conversation Knowledge Mining solution accelerator was published on 08/15/2024. If you deployed the accelerator prior to that date, please see “Version history” in the [Supporting documentation](#supporting-documentation) section.

### Technical key features

- **Data processing:** Microsoft Fabric processes both audio and conversation files at scale, leveraging its benefits for efficient and scalable data handling
- **Summarization and key phrase extraction​:** Azure OpenAI is used to summarize long conversations into concise paragraphs and extract relevant key phrases
- **Speech transcription and diarization​:** Azure Speech is used to transcribe audio files, including speaker diarization for post-call analytics. Diarization is the process of recognizing and separating individual speakers into mono-channel audio data​
- **Analytics dashboard​:** Power BI is used to visualize the correlation between operational metrics and AI-generated conversational data​

### Use case / scenario

A contact center manager reviews contact center performance to ensure resources are being used efficiently. To identify areas for improvement, they need to understand the correlation between conversational and operational data. ​

The contact center manager uses their dashboard to identify how LLM-generated conversational analytics and insights are impacting operations to make an informed decision about how to improve their center’s performance.​

### Target end users

Company personnel (employees, executives) looking to gain conversational insights in correlation with operational Contact Center metrics would leverage this accelerator to find what they need quickly.

### Business value
- **Conversation analysis​:** Generative AI analyzes call transcripts, summarizes content, identifies and aggregates key phrases for data visualization​
- **Automated customer satisfaction​:** Generative AI determines the post-call satisfaction rating of a customer’s experience with their agent
- **Operational clarity​:** Relevant metrics such as call volume, handling time, and call resolution are pulled from the same call logs for operational data visualization​
- **Unified data:** ​Unstructured (call transcripts) and structured (operational metrics) data are both analyzed and visualized within the same application​
- **Targeted decision enablement:** Enable agents and managers to achieve glanceable insight recognition, corollary information analysis, and accelerated decision making​

### Products used/licenses required

-   Azure Speech Service

-   Azure OpenAI

-   Microsoft Fabric Capacity

-   The user deploying the template must have permission to create
    resources and resource groups.

### **How to install/deploy**

1. **Deploy Azure resources**  
   Click the following deployment button to create the required resources for this accelerator directly in your Azure Subscription.

   [![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FRoopan-Microsoft%2FCustomer-Service-Conversational-Insights-with-Azure-OpenAI-Services%2Fmain%2FDeployment%2Fbicep%2Fmain.json)

   1.  Most fields will have a default name set already. You will need to update the following Azure OpenAI settings:

       -  Region - the region where the resources will be created in

       -  Solution Prefix - provide a 6 alphanumeric value that will be used to prefix resources
      
       -  Location - location of resources, by default it will use the resource group's location
           
2.  **Create Fabric workspace**
    1.  Navigate to ([Fabric Workspace](https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/))

3.  **Deploy Fabric resources and artifacts**
    1.   Navigate to ([Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/))
    2.   Click on Azure Cloud Shell in the top right of navigation Menu (add image)
    3.   Run the run the following commands:  
         1.   ```az login``` ***Follow instructions in Azure Cloud Shell for login instructions
         2.   ```rm -rf ./Customer-Service-Conversational-Insights-with-Azure-OpenAI-Services```
         3.   ```git clone https://github.com/Roopan-Microsoft/Customer-Service-Conversational-Insights-with-Azure-OpenAI-Services```
         4.   ```cd ./Customer-Service-Conversational-Insights-with-Azure-OpenAI-Services/Deployment/scripts/fabric_scripts```
         5.   ```sh ./run_fabric_items_scripts.sh keyvault_param workspaceid_param solutionprefix_param```
              1.   keyvault_param - the name of the keyvault that was created in Step 1
              2.   workspaceid_param - the workspaceid created in Step 2
              3.   solutionprefix_param - prefix used to append to lakehouse upon creation
    4.  Get Fabric Lakehouse connection details:
    5.   Once deployment is complete, navigate to Fabric Workspace
    6.   Find Lakehouse in workspace (ex.lakehouse_*solutionprefix_param*)
    7.   Click on the ```...``` next to the SQL Analytics Endpoint
    8.   Click on ```Copy SQL connection string```
    9.   Click Copy button in popup window.
    10.  Wait 10-15 minutes to allow the data pipelines to finish processing then proceed to next step.
4.  **Open Power BI report**
    1.   Download the .pbix file from the [Reports folder](Deployment/Reports/).
    2.   Open Power BI report in Power BI Dashboard
    3.   Click on `Transform Data` menu option from the Task Bar
    4.   Click `Data source settings`
    5.   Click `Change Source...`
    6.   Input the Server link (from Fabric Workspace)

    10. Click `Sign in`
    11. Navigate back to Fabric workspace and click on Power BI report
6.  **Schedule Post-Processing Notebook**  
    It is essential to update dates daily as they advance based on the current day at the time of deployment. Since the Power BI report relies on the current date, we highly recommend scheduling or running the 03_post_processing notebook daily in the workspace. Please note that this process modifies the original date of the processed data. If you do not wish to run this, do not execute the 03_post_processing notebook.
    
    To schedule the notebook, follow these steps:
    - Navigate to the Workspace
    - Click on the "..." next to the 03_post_processing notebook
    - Select "Schedule"
    - Configure the schedule settings (we **recommend** running the notebook *at least daily*)



### Process audio files
Currently, audio files are not processed during deployment. To manually process audio files, follow these steps:
- Open the `pipeline_notebook`
- Comment out cell 2 (only if there are zero files in the `conversation_input` data folder waiting for JSON processing)
- Uncomment cells 3 and 4
- Run `pipeline_notebook`


### Upload additional files

All files JSON and WAV files can be uploaded in the corresponding Lakehouse in the data/Files folder:

- Conversation (JSON files): 
  Upload JSON files in the *conversation_input* folder.

- Audio (WAV files):
  Upload Audio files in the *audio_input* folder.


### Post-deployment
- To process additional files, manually execute the pipeline_notebook after uploading new files.
- The OpenAI prompt can be modified within the Fabric notebooks.

### How to customize

If you'd like to customize the accelerator, here are some ways you might do that:
- Modify the Power BI report to use a custom logo
- Ingest your own [JSON conversation files](ConversationalDataFormat.md) by uploading them into the `conversation_input` lakehouse folder and run the data pipeline
- Ingest your own [audio conversation files](ConversationalDataFormat.md) by uploading them into the `audio_input` lakehouse folder and run the data pipeline
